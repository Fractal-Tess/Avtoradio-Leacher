### What is this?

This is a simple desktop app that leaches a readable stream of audio data from the avtoradio radio streaming server.

### Why was it made?

I was tired of constantly having to open a chrome instance/tab in order to listen to my favorite audio. Not to mention my lack of ability to close tabs prevented me from finding it again once it was open and running.
